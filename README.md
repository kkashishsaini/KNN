# KNN
K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm. The k-nearest neighbors algorithm, also known as KNN or k-NN, is a non-parametric, supervised learning classifier, which uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point. 
IT IS A SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM. 
MACHINE LEARNING 
IN THIS PROJECT I HAVE USED KNN TO PREDICT THE ACCURACY OF A MODEL ON THE DATASET - " IRIS " ( ATTACHED IN PROJECT )
